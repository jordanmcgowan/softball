## Welcome to Summer Softball!

This site will be the official source of truth for all things scheduling related for the summer softball league. 

If you are new to 5v5v5 softball, please review the rules [here](https://static.spokanecity.org/documents/recreation/sports/tournaments/2017/softball-5v5v5-rules-2017.pdf). The only difference we will have from these rules is that one team will play the left side of the field (L, LC, 3B, SS, and C) and one team will play the right side (R, RC, 1B, 2B, and P). This will *hopefully* force more team interaction. 

The first team listed in the matchup will bat **first**, the second team will take the RIGHT side of the field, and the last team the LEFT side. The teams will then rotate **clockwise** for 3 innings, then rotate. For the rotation process, the team in left stays in left, the team in right comes in to bat, and the team batting goes to right, then teams will rotate **counter-clockwise** for 3 more innings. 

For ties, the two teams that tied will both be awarded the points of the lower position.

# Upcoming Schedule

Below is the schedule for the next few weeks (see below for the full schedule). Games will be every Monday at 6:30 Bryn Mawr #4 and #5 (*Field subject to change based on availability*).

***The final standings (see below) determined the matchups for P1***

# Rosters

Below are the team rosters, with the captain's name in ***bold and italics***. Players should be responsible for finding a sub if they cannot make it to a game, but ultimately that responsibility will fall on the captains to ensure they can field a team!
